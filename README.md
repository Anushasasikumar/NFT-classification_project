## üìå Conclusion
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to classify NFT investments as either profit or loss based on selected attributes. Using five different classification algorithms - Linear Discriminative Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network - we achieved consistently high performance across the board.

All the models demonstrated excellent results, with an average accuracy of approximately **99%**, indicating that the selected features were highly effective in capturing the underlying patterns of profitable versus loss-making NFTs.

To evaluate model performance, we used multiple metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and visualized the results using **precision-recall graphs** and **confusion matrices**. These insights confirm that our model not only performs well in terms of overall accuracy but also minimizes false positives, which is crucial in financial decision-making.

This study highlights the strength of machine learning in analyzing NFT investment potential and sets a foundation for further exploration with real-time data and price prediction tasks.
